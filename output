    When I ran the program, it calculated the distance between the two points 
as 1.73. Then, it used an elapsed time of 5 seconds to calculate velocity, 
which resulted in 0.35. However, when the program tried to calculate velocity 
at time = 0 seconds, it ran into an error because time can't be zero in a 
velocity calculation. The program printed an error message.

    After switching the times, the program still showed the same 1.73 for 
distance, but an error also occured because it tried to divide by 0 seconds, so 
it didnâ€™t get to the second calculation. But after handling the error, the next 
velocity calculation using 5 seconds worked and gave a result of 1.73 again. 
This proves that the program correctly calculates velocity and can properly 
handle zero time errors.
